# Data-science-end-to-end

This repository is a collection of all the algorithms and techniques being which have been developed and implemented since the advent of Machine Learning era. I would like to thank (Coding Blocks)[https://github.com/coding-blocks] for it's wonderful Data Science course which has helped to construct, add and modify many parts of this repository. I hope whoever is looking for implementation codes for various ML/AI techniques will find this repository helpful and enlightening. Some components of the repository are incomplete and future updates will aim towards a more wholesome and completed form of this collection.

## Topics covered:
- Basics of Python
- Data acquisition and web scraping
- Understanding various ML libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and so on.
